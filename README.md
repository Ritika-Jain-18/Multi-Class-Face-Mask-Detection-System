# Multi-Class Face Mask Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to the Multi-Class Face Mask Detection System repository! This project aims to detect face masks in images and classify them into different classes based on the mask-wearing behavior. The system is designed to identify three classes: "Correctly Worn," "Incorrectly Worn," and "Not Worn."

## Introduction

In the context of the ongoing global pandemic, the importance of wearing face masks has been emphasized to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This project provides a solution for automated face mask detection and classification, which can be useful in various scenarios such as public spaces, workplaces, and healthcare settings.

## Features

- Multi-class face mask detection: Correctly Worn, Incorrectly Worn, Not Worn.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Supports image input for real-time and batch processing.
- Pre-trained model for quick deployment.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a carefully curated dataset, which includes images of individuals with different mask-wearing behaviors, annotated with corresponding labels. This dataset comprises 853 images with annotations in PASCAL VOC format, divided into three classes: ”With mask,” ”Without mask,” and ”Mask worn incorrectly.”

## RESULTS 
Preliminary results from the training process indicate an overall accuracy of approximately
69.89%. The confusion matrix from the model’s predictions revealed an uneven distribution of
accuracy across classes, attributed to the imbalance in the dataset.
