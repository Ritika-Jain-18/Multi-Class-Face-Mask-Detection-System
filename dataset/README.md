This dataset comprises 853 images with annotations in PASCAL VOC format, divided into three
classes: ”With mask,” ”Without mask,” and ”Mask worn incorrectly.” It facilitates the development
of a precise model for detecting individuals wearing masks correctly, those without masks, and those
with masks worn improperly.
